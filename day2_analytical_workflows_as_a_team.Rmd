### Coding as a team
- helps you grow as a programmer! well documented work, communicating

#### Code review/feedback 
- asynchronous team activity
- great opportunity to have more eyes on your code
- reviewer should see this activity as a great way to learn from others 

### Pair programming
- synchronous team activity: several programmers get to work together on the same piece of code 
- Driver = the person typing at the computer
- Navigator(s) = do  not write code, focus on finding solutions to the problem. use of their computer should be limited to searching online for solutions
